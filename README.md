# GAT-Informer
The code in this repository implements multivariate time series spatiotemporal prediction by combining Informer and GAT. And its corresponding paper is 《Attention mechanism is useful in spatio-temporal wind speed prediction: Evidence from China》.

For commercial reasons, the original code and data cannot be open sourced. In this version, we modified some of the structure of the code to ensure that it can run on public data sets (PEMS04).

If the code is helpful to you, please cite the following paper:
